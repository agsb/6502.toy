# Modules

## Extended Memory Banks

A module with a 74HC04, 74HC10, 74HC373. For use the illegal instruction 3/B as code for a latch.
Use D0, D1, /D2 and SYNC for select a lacth of D3, D4, D5, D6, D7 as Ax15, Ax16, Ax17, Ax18, Ax19, for address up to 32 banks of 32k bytes, 
this can select 1Mb of SRAM.

eg, 

    Just two AS6C4008, 512k SRAM, A0 to A18, with Ax15-Ax18 as A15-A18, selected by Ax19 and /Ax19

    A pool of 74hc138 using Ax15-Ax19 to select one of 32, HM62256, 32k SRAM, or one of 16 UM61512AK 64kb SRAM.
