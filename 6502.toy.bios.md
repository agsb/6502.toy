(still not finished)

## Hardware
    
    What was a minimum STC, envolve to a complex multifaced system

    Generics, RAM is DIP SRAM, ROM is DIP EEPROM, REM is a I2C/SPI EEPROM 

## BIOS

    The BIOS is a forth based system, inspired by the R65F02

    The 'bare bones' BIOS must have:

    - set_spi, prepare spi
    - set_i2c, prepare i2c
    - set_sram, prepare sram page
    
    - getc, uart get a char 
    - putc, uart put a char
    - getcq, verify to get
    - putcq, verify to put
    
    - getp, generic port get
    - putp, generic port put
    
    - beep, as is
    - tone, play a tone
    
    - tick_put, write into counter
    - tick_get, read from counter
    - tick_run, starts counter
    - tick_hlt, stops counter
    
    - roulette, random number from 0 to 36
    - seed, random seed from 0 to $FF
    - random, returns a random number from 0 to $FF

    - ram2ram, copy bytes from RAM to RAM
    - rem2ram, copy bytes from REM to RAM
    - ram2rem, copy bytes from RAM to REM
    
    - hex2bin, convert a hexagesimal ascii to byte ($00 to $FF)
    - bin2hex, convert a byte to hexagesimal ascii ($00 to $FF)
    
## Forth

    The Forth uses Minimal Thread Indirect Code, with all primitives
    bellow a mark address.

### Primitives

```
    inner core: 

        exit, unnest, next, pick, nest, link, jump,
        push, pull, execute, setup, interrupt,
        drop, dup, swap, over, rot, -rot,
        negate, invert, and, or, xor, 
        +, -, 2/, 2*, 2+, 2-, 1+, 1-,
        r>, >r, r@, sp@, rp@, sp!, rp!,
        for, next, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
        
        putc, getc,
        DP, here, alloc, comma, colon, semmis,
        find, tick, 
        BL, CR, expect, word, parse, BASE, number,
        docon, dovar, dodoes, pscode,

```
