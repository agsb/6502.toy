# A 6502 toy

(this file is a stub)

## Introduction

_I seek for learn, not for speed._

I had an Apple II. The Furby was a two 6502 'like' toy. I want make a SBC minimal as my toy.

There are many "clones" [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/6502), [Mike](https://github.com/mike42/6502-computer), [Maarten](https://github.com/maarten-pennings/6502/tree/master), [Grant](http://searle.x10host.com/6502/Simple6502.html), [√Ålvarez](https://www.ele.uva.es/~jesus/6502copy/proto.html) and others.

And a Great support from [6502.org](http://6502.org/) forum and [Wilson Mines Co](http://wilsonminesco.com/).

This is a board for learn and testing the version for 6502 of Minimal Indirect Thread Code Forth as [IMMU](https://github.com/agsb/immu)

PS.

- [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU) made a revival of 6502. 
- using ROM, for read-only memory, never changes
- using RAM, for random access memory, ever changes
- using REM, for regular eeprom memory, could change (I2C, SPI, etc)
        
## Road Map

- make all circuit plans
- make a eeprom programmer like [Ben Eater](https://github.com/beneater/eeprom-programmer), but using arduino nano and change pins used.
- make a nop circuit to test cpus, using a arduino mini and [clockvar6502](https://github.com/maarten-pennings/6502/blob/master/1clock/clockvar6502)

## Topics

The 6502's default frequency of about 1 MHz is merely illustrative, compared to the 3.6 GHz of current CPUs.
   
The USART is at 9600/19200 bps, 8-N-1, duplex. fixed, no changes.

The I2C EEPROM used as Hard Disk, 1k block, 64 bytes (screens).
        
All devices are CMOS and 5V capable.        

Use wire wrap. 

Test NMOS-6502, CMOS-65C02,

The actual memory map will be 56k SRAM $0000-$DFFF, 256b Devices $E000-$E0FF and $E100-$FFFF 8k ROM. 

The board will have one 6551 ACIA and two 6522 VIA inside, with expansion of more 4 devices.

The devices are mapped at $E000 to $E0FF, reserving 16 bytes for control for each device. 

Also using a 3:8 74HC138 decoder, with $0 reserved, $1 ACIA, $2 VIA, $3 VIA, onboard and $4 to $7 at expansion.

A clock board by crystal of 1.8432 for CIA and by 74HC74 of 0.9612 for CPU, with a Real Timer Click as NMI with 10ms delay using a VIA T1 timer.

No video or keyboard, using terminal at USART 19200 8N1, RS-232, vt-100.

Using a LCD 16x4 by I2C, a keyboard with 6/12 keys, a beeper, a speaker and a pool of leds, for minimal use.

Using I2C and SPI protocols and devices. 

The board have 2 x 8-pins slots for I2C epproms.

Use MicroChip AARDVARK connector, interface I2C and SPI

Use [UEXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEXT) interface for USART, I2C, SPI, 3V3

Use [65SIB](http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?t=1064&start=105) for alternative interface.

## Software

                At boot BIOS does have all functions and loads a monitor to RAM, or 
                At boot, the bios will copy bytes from a I2C eeprom into RAM and jump to it.

Use a BIOS and Forth, 

Use USART for VT100 terminal, FDDI/USB for Tera-Term or PuTTy at computer.

### Bios

generic routines at bios:

    - ram2ram, copy bytes from RAM to RAM
    - rem2ram, copy bytes from REM to RAM
    - ram2rem, copy bytes from RAM to REM
    
    - set_spi, prepare spi
    - set_i2c, prepare i2c
    - set_sram, prepare sram page
    
    - getc, uart get a char 
    - putc, uart put a char
    - getcq, verify to get
    - putcq, verify to put
    
    - getp, generic port get
    - putp, generic port put
    
    - beep, as is
    - tone, play a tone
    
    - tick_put, write into counter
    - tick_get, read from counter
    - tick_run, starts counter
    - tick_hlt, stops counter
    
    - roulette, random number from 0 to 36
    - seed, random seed from 0 to $FF
    - random, returns a random number from 0 to $FF

    - hex2bin, convert a hexagesimal ascii to byte ($00 to $FF)
    - bin2hex, convert a byte to hexagesimal ascii ($00 to $FF)
    
## Memory 

The first 4k of RAM $0000-$0FFF is reserved for system.

The $03FF 1k reserved for system, and $E0-$FF 32 bytes at page zero. 

The Extended Wozniac Monitor uses RAM at $0200-$027F as terminal input buffer and $24-$2B at page zero. 

The page $0300-$03FF is a list of references for devices and system (BIOS, MOS) routines.

The pages $0400-$0FFF are reserved for future expansion, programs start at $1000.

The Forth uses RAM from $1000 to $DFFF, $00D0-$00DF 16 bytes at page zero and ???? to ???? at page one.

## Ideas

1. Boot: Use 32k SRAM-1 + 32k SRAM-0 + 8k EEPROM (shadow) and devices. Two HM62256 and a AT28C64.

2. Oper: Use 32k SRAM-1 + banks x 32k SRAM-N over 0x0000 to 0x7FFF, mapped by PB0-PB3 of 6522, + 32k SRAM-0 fixed, eeprom shadow at last 8k. Each bank is a task and fixed RAM as shared memory; 

3. Other: The initial memory map was to be like an Apple II, $0000-$BFFF 48k RAM, $C000-$CFFF 4k Devices, $D000-$FFFF 12k ROM.

PS. Note the fixed SRAM is named SRAM-0 and hold at 0x8000 to 0xFFFF, with 256 bytes for devices and shadow the 0xE00 to 0xFFF from EEPROM. This alllows use the A15 line as selector.
