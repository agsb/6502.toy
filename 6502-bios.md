## Hardware
    
    . minimal 2 kb (256 bytes for 16 devices mapper) boot EPROM
    . full 64 kb RAM system
    . copy main FORTH from EEPROM to RAM
    . use I2C EEPROMs as Hard Disk

    1   MOS6502 (or W65C02)
    1   N6551       VIA
    2   M6522       PIA
    2   HM65256     32k RAM
    1   AT28C16     2k EEPROM
    8   AT24C256    32k I2C EEPROM
    1   Xtal        1.8 MHz
    1   74HC74
    N   74HC00
    
   The 6502's default frequency of about 1 MHz is merely illustrative, 
   compared to the 3.6 GHz of current CPUs.
   
   the USART is at 9600 bps, 8-N-1, duplex. fixed, no changes.

   the I2C EEPROM used as Hard Disk, 1k block, 64 bytes (screens).

 ## BIOS

### Primitives

```
    inner core: 

        unnest, next, pick, nest, link, jump,
        colon, semmis, comma, tick, word, parse, expect,
        docon, dovar, dodoes, pscode, execute,
        push, pull, put,
        drop, dup, swap, over, rot, -rot,
        and, or, xor, +, -, 2/, 2*, 2+, 2-, 1+, 1-,
        r>, >r, r@, sp@, rp@, sp!, rp!,
        for, next, setup, 
        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, BL, CR,
        DP, here, alloc, 
        interrupt,

   the 'bare bones' BIOS must have:

       millis,     return milliseconds
       getch,      get a byte from USART/COMM port
       putch,      put a byte into USART/COMM port
       qgetch,     verify if get a byte from USART/COMM port
       qputch,     verify if put a byte into USART/COMM port
       getio,      get a byte from a GPIO/DEVICE
       putio,      put a byte into a GPIO/DEVICE
    
    i2c core:
