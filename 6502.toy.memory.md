# 6502.toy memory map

Some ideas about memory spaces

## Basic Map

### Hardware

#### RAM

$0000  page zero, hardware used

$0100  page one, hardware stack

#### ROM

$FFFA  NMI

#FFFC  Reset

#FFFE  IRQ

### Extras

$0200  buffer getline, system

$0300  system vectors, system

$0400 -- $FFF7 

## classic

### mode 1
$0000 32k SRAM + 32k SRAM 
$E000 256b devices, shadow
$E100 8k EEPROM, shadow

### mode 2
$0000 32k SRAM + 32k SRAM
$0400 256b devices, shadow
$E000 8k EEPROM, shadow

### mode 3
$0000 32k SRAM0
$8000 16k SRAM0, and multiple pages of 16k SRAM ( 1 to n )
$C000  8k SRAM0, system buffers
$E000  8k EEPROM

## Mapper for Devices

Mapping RAM, ROM and DEV from high byte address (A15-A8) using 74HC30, 74HC04 and 74HC00.

The devices could be at for any 256 bytes page from $02 to $FE, reserved $00, $01 and $FF.

| ROM | DEV | CE_RAM | CE_ROM | CE_DEV | LOGIC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | CE_RAM = not ( ROM and DEV ) |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | CE_ROM = not ( not (ROM) and DEV ) |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | CE_DEV = not ( not (ROM) and not (DEV) ) |
| 0 | 1 | X | X | X | never |
| | | | | |

The DEV is mapped at $FE, using A15 to A9 direct and A8 with one NOT from the 74HC04, into a 8xNAND of the 74HC30, resulting in DEV signal.

The ROM is mapped at $E0, using A15 to A13, into one 3xNAND of the 74HC10, resulting in ROM signal.

The RAM is mapped with ROM and DEV, into one 2xNAND of the 74HC00, resulting in CE_RAM signal.
