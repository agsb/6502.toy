# 6502.toy memory map

Some ideas about memory spaces

## Hardware Map

### must be ram

$0000  page zero, hardware used

$0100  page one, hardware stack

### must be rom

$FFFA  NMI
#FFFC  Reset
#FFFE  IRQ

## Usual

$0200  buffer getline, system

$0300  system vectors, system

$0400 -- $FFF7, free

## classic

The 6502 is a 8bit processor with 8bit registers, then make sense use pages of 256 bytes as references.

### ROM 

The ROM at pages $E0 and $F0, maped as a shadow over SRAM, using A15, A14, A13 on a 3x NAND (74HC10) to select;

The boot cold code is at $FF00 and the boot vector is at $FFFA to $FFFF;

### Devices

The devices are mapped into a single 256 page using A15 to A8 on a 8 port NAND (74HC30) to select with some lines with a NOT (74HC04) to form the select page;

Must not use the $00 page zero or $01 page one or $FF page page boot. 

By easy, the page $FE is used for mapping 16 devices with 16 address, using a 8x NAND (74HC30) in A15 to A8, with a NOT (74HC04) in A8; 

The high nibble A7 to A4 are demultiplexed (two 74HC138) into 16 select pin for each device. The lower nibble A3 to A0 define the actions or functions;

The interrupt request for each device is handled by two 3x NAND (74HC10), with some glue logic for a /IRQ signal;

## Mapper for Devices

Mapping RAM, ROM and DEV from high byte address (A15-A8) using 74HC30, 74HC04 and 74HC00.

The devices could be at for any 256 bytes page from $02 to $FE, reserved $00, $01 and $FF.

| ROM | DEV | /ROM | /DEV | CE_RAM | CE_ROM | CE_DEV | LOGIC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | CE_RAM = not ( ROM ) |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |1 | 0 | 1 | CE_ROM = not ( CS_RAM and DEV ) |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | CE_DEV = not ( CS_RAM and not (DEV) ) |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | X | X | X | never happens, DEV depends on ROM |
| | | | | | | |


### RAM

### mode fixed

$0000 32k SRAM + 32k SRAM, 

### mode banks

$0000 32k SRAM0, or multiple banks of 32k SRAM ( 0 to 7 ),
$8000 16k SRAM0, or multiple banks of 16k SRAM ( 0 to 15 ),
$C000  8k SRAM0, for system buffers, fixed on SRAM0,
